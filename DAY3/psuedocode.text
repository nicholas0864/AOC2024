s = ""
current string we're looking at 

iterate over each character of input

check if s has mul( in it
if it does have mul check if mul exists twice
if it does go to the second one, then take the numbers, make them into an array and add the total

if it doesnt have two just do the end of the one before

if it has do() turn on to true vice versa if it doesnt and reset s

if s doesnt start wiht mul or do or dont just reset it and keep going
